<p>There are two main interfaces in Objenesis:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="${javadoc}/org/objenesis/instantiator/ObjectInstantiator.html">ObjectInstantiator</a></strong>
        - Instantiates multiple instances of a single class.
        <pre>interface ObjectInstantiator {
  Object newInstance();
}</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong><a href="${javadoc}/org/objenesis/strategy/InstantiatorStrategy.html">InstantiatorStrategy</a></strong>
        - A particular strategy for how to instantiate a class (as this differs for different types of classes).
        <pre>interface InstantiatorStrategy {
  ObjectInstantiator newInstantiatorOf(Class type);
}</pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All Objenesis classes are in the
    <strong><code>org.objenesis</code></strong> package.</p>

<h1>Step By Step</h1>

<p>There are many different strategies that Objenesis uses for instantiating objects based on the JVM vendor,
JVM version, SecurityManager and type of class being instantiated.</p>

<p>We have defined that two different kinds of instantiation are required:</p>
   
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stardard</strong> - No constructor will be called</li>
    <li><strong>Serializable compliant</strong> - Acts like an object instantiated by java standard 
        serialization. It means that the constructor of the first non-serializable parent class will
        be called. However, readResolve is not called and we never check if the object is serializable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The simplest way to use Objenesis is by using <a href="${javadoc}/org/objenesis/ObjenesisStd.html">ObjenesisStd</a> (Standard) and 
<a href="${javadoc}/org/objenesis/ObjenesisSerializer.html">ObjenesisSerializer</a> (Serializable compliant). By default, 
automatically determines the best strategy - so you don't have to.</p>

<pre>Objenesis objenesis = new ObjenesisStd(); // or ObjenesisSerializer</pre>

<p>Once you have the Objenesis implementation, you can then create an <code>ObjectInstantiator</code>, for a specific type.</p>

<pre>ObjectInstantiator thingyInstantiator = objenesis.getInstantiatorOf(MyThingy.class);</pre>

<p>Finally, you can use this to instantiate new instances of this type.</p>

<pre>MyThingy thingy1 = (MyThingy)thingyInstantiator.newInstance();
MyThingy thingy2 = (MyThingy)thingyInstantiator.newInstance();
MyThingy thingy3 = (MyThingy)thingyInstantiator.newInstance();</pre>

<h1>Performance and Threading</h1>

<p>To improve performance, it is best to reuse the <code>ObjectInstantiator</code>
    objects as much as possible. For example, if you are instantiating multiple instances of a specific class,
    do it from the same <code>ObjectInstantiator</code>.
</p>

<p>Both <code>InstantiatorStrategy</code> and <code>ObjectInstantiator</code> can be shared between multiple
    threads and used concurrently. They are thread safe.</p>

<h1>That Code Again</h1>

<p>(For the impatient)</p>

<pre>
Objenesis objenesis = new ObjenesisStd(); // or ObjenesisSerializer
MyThingy thingy1 = (MyThingy) objenesis.newInstance(MyThingy.class);

// or (a little bit more efficient if you need to create many objects)

Objenesis objenesis = new ObjenesisStd(); // or ObjenesisSerializer
ObjectInstantiator thingyInstantiator = objenesis.getInstantiatorOf(MyThingy.class);

MyThingy thingy2 = (MyThingy)thingyInstantiator.newInstance();
MyThingy thingy3 = (MyThingy)thingyInstantiator.newInstance();
MyThingy thingy4 = (MyThingy)thingyInstantiator.newInstance();
</pre>
